        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Much like nobody tells you what you can/cannot talk about when you're spending time in a
                public space with others, we'd like Cliques to be the same as much as possible, but
                not at the expense of other members. Should a member disrespect the public space by
                being rude or disruptive, they will be shown the door.</p>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        <h4>Don't be hurtful.</h4>
                        <p>There's a difference between being critical and going out of your way to say
                                things in a mean way that hurts others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <h4>Don't be hateful.</h4>
                        <p>Posts that attack or demean others because of their race, religion, or sex may be removed.
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <h4>Don't spam.</h4>
                        <p>Did you put your heart into making something and feel excited to share it
                                with your local community? That's cool, so long as you're not going
                                around and aggressively trying to push it on people. Advertising posts
                                will be removed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <h4>Don't break the terms of use.</h4>
                        <p>Breaking any of the <a href="/terms">terms of use</a> is grounds for account
                                suspension and/or a permanent ban.</p>
                </li>
